        "The Saint Helens Residence Hall is a five-story student residence tucked into the curve of Blumel Hall, opposite Parking 3 to the west, and King Albert and the Stephen Epler Hall to the south.",
        "St. Helens is part of the Second Year Experience residential program and features furnished, double-occupancy, one-bedroom and studio residences available Fall through Spring term with amenities such as private bathrooms (bathtub and shower) and kitchens (oven and full-size refrigerator). The interior of the building underwent a $6.4 million renovation completed in July 2019. Improvements were made both to the living units and the building's systems including new in-room finishes with updated kitchens and bathrooms, comprehensive hot & cold water piping replacements, mechanical exhaust improvements, and electrical upgrades. There is no elevator in the building.",
        "",
        "The Saint Helens building was built in 1928 for the real estate developer, Harry Mittleman, who called it the Saint Helen's Court Apartments. Mittleman named several of his apartment buildings after family members; Saint Helen's was presumably named after his wife, Helen. Portland Student Services purchased the site in 1969 to serve exclusively as Portland State student housing."
