        "Designed by Wolff & Zimmer, construction on the West Heating Plant was completed on October 15, 1966 as part of the Health & Physical Education Building (now Peter Stott Center) project. Zimmer Gunsul Frasca Architects designed an addition to the plant completed in 1974, which doubled the size of the building and added an additional boiler.
