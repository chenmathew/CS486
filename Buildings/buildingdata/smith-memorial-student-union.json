    "about": [
        "Smith Memorial Student Union (SMSU) is a four-story building with two basement levels located between SW Park, Montgomery, Broadway, and Harrison. It is the building just south of Cramer Hall and north of Fariborz Maseeh Hall. Skybridges on the third and fourth floors lead to Cramer Hall and Fariborz Maseeh Hall. The third floor skybridge also connects to the University Services Building, School of Business Administration, the School of Education, and Parking Structure 2. Tunnels from the basement level lead to Cramer Hall to the North, and Fariborz Maseeh Hall to the South.",
        "SMSU is PSU\u2019s student union and includes a food court on the first floor; a games room in the basement; a ballroom for events on the third and fourth floors; and offices for student organizations, groups, and other services throughout the building.",
        "SMSU was the second building constructed for Portland State and was built in four separate phases between 1956 and 1966. Phase 1 was completed on May 28, 1958. The second phase completed on January 5, 1960, in the northeast corner, was known as Library East until 2012 and possesses separate mechanical and electrical systems.  Library East was Portland State College\u2019s central library until the construction of Library West (now Millar Library) in 1968. Phase 3 (Addition 1) added the southwest corner of the building and additional work on the northwest corner was completed October 28, 1961 with the final southeast phase (Addition 2) completed on May 28, 1965. The first three phases (NW, NE/Library East, and SW) were all designed by the architects, Lawrence, Tucker & Wallman, with the original unit also benefiting from the consulting services of college union pioneer, Porter Butts. The final SE addition was designed by Mockford and Rudd.",
        "SMSU is named after Michael J. Smith who helped lead Portland State College\u2019s GE College Bowl team to victory in 1965. The College Bowl team\u2019s undefeated winning streak was credited by Time magazine (March 26, 1965 p. 46) with being a major factor in influencing the state legislature to fund graduate programming as well as helping transform the College\u2019s public image as \u201cthe flunk-out school\u201d for University of Oregon and Oregon State University drop-outs. Despite appearing in all five games, Michael Smith suffered from cystic fibrosis and was frequently hospitalized during the nine months of preparation for the College ",
