    "about": [
        "University Pointe is a student housing building occupying the majority of the block bounded by SW College, 5th, Jackson, and 6th. Constructed in 2013, the building is unique among PSU buildings in that its land is owned by PSU but the building itself is owned and operated independently by the Texas-based company, American Campus Communities. The building includes a fitness center, computer center, study lounges, social lounges, and retail establishments on the ground floor. The US Green Building Council has certified University Pointe LEED Gold for its various sustainability features including low-flow plumbing fixtures, energy-efficient heating/cooling systems, an eco-roof, and an on-site recycling center. Prior to its completion the building was originally called Jackson Housing then College Station Housing before finally settling on University Pointe."
