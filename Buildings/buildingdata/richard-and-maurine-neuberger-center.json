    "about": [
        "Richard & Maurine Neuberger Center (RMNC) is a nine-story concrete and glass building on SW 4th Avenue between Market and Mill Streets. The building includes two-levels of parking for 177 vehicles including 106 permit, 64 paid-hourly, and 7 accessible parking places. The main entry is accessed via a stairway along SW 4th Avenue. Currently, the only accessible entry is located by traveling through the upper parking level entrance along Market Street to the east-side entrance.",
        "RMNC was originally constructed in 1968 as part of the South Auditorium Urban Renewal Project. It was designed by architects, Skidmore Owings & Merrill, as an office building called the Portland Center. The building was later acquired by Boise Cascade before passing to the Cellular One company in the 1990s. Cellular One was then acquired by AT&T and later became Cingular Wireless with the building changing its name to reflect these various telecommunication name changes. ",
        "PSU began leasing space on the 8th floor starting in 2006 before purchasing the entire property in 2012.  RMNC currently houses the Office of the President and serves as the central hub of PSU's administration.",
        "On December 6, 2018 the building was re-named the Richard & Maurine Neuberger Center in honor of Richard and Maurine Neuberger. The name Neuberger has been associated with Portland State University since well before 1972 when PSU renamed the former South Park Hall after journalist, politician, and longtime PSU supporter, Richard L. Neuberger. The new name was chosen by the University as a way of carrying on the Neuberger name while the old Neuberger Hall \u2013 which has been renamed to Fariborz Maseeh Hall \u2013 underwent a massive renovation. Oregon Sen. Richard Neuberger and his wife, Rep. Maurine Neuberger, worked for years in the Oregon Legislature to establish Portland State (at that time the Vanport Extension Center) as a four-year college. Their work paid off when a bill establishing Portland State as a degree-granting institution was passed into law in February 1955. The college gained university status in 1969.",
