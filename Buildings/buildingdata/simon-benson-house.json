        "The Simon Benson House is a Queen Anne style residence, built by lumber baron Simon Benson in 1901. Over time the home fell into disrepair and was condemned by the City of Portland in 1991. With financial support from more than 1,000 individuals and businesses, and spearheaded by the Friends of Simon Benson House, the house was moved from its original location on the corner of SW 11th and Clay to SW Park and Montgomery on PSU campus on January 16, 2000. Renovation of the house took nearly a year, with P & C Construction supervising and some 30 subcontractors participating. SERA Architects of Portland donated their services for the renovation project.",
        "Simon Benson House now sits west across the Park Blocks from Smith Center and shares a block with two PSU residence halls, Montgomery Court and the Blackstone. The first floor of the Simon Benson House is used for University and Community functions. PSU's Office of Alumni Relations is located on the second floor.",
