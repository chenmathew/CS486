It is north of the University Center Building and south of the Urban Center Building.",
        "The ASRC's recreation facilities include two wood-floor courts; an indoor soccer/multi-sport court with dasher boards; 1/11 mile, three-lane running track; 80+ pieces of cardio equipment and 100+ pieces of weight training equipment; multi-purpose group fitness suites; an aquatic complex including a six-lane lap pool and 10-person spa; a 32-foot climbing wall; two locker rooms, each with over 400 lockers; and two universal changing rooms with showers. Services include free, daily, drop-in group exercise classes; affordable personal training options; free day-use lockers; dedicated locker with towel service for a small fee; and equipment checkout options.",
        "The second, third, and fourth floors house the Student Recreation Center while the rest of the floors are divided amongst academic, student workspaces, retail businesses, and other spaces. The first floor houses retail spaces and PSU\u2019s Transportation and Parking office as well as the main building lobby and the University Welcome Center. The fifth and sixth floors are respectively home to the City of Portland's Archives & Records Center and the PSU School of Social Work.",
        "Completed in late 2009 and opened for use on January 3, 2010, the building was designed by Yost Grube Hall Architecture at a cost of $72 million. It replaced a one-story PSU structure, known as the Portland Center for Advanced Technology (PCAT), which PSU had leased from the City of Portland beginning in 1983 before purchasing it for $2.1 million in 1985. The ASRC is LEED Gold certified with sustainability features that include photovoltaic panels on the roof, electricity generating elliptical machines, plumbing and fire protection systems powered by a rainwater, and numerous heat recovery systems."
