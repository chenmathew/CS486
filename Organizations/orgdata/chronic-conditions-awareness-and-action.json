      "description": "<p>This organization is called Chronic Conditions Awareness and Action (CCAA). Chronic illness such as diabetes, arthritis, cancer, asthma, crohn&rsquo;s disease, ulcerative colitis, schizophrenia, AIDS, etc. affects the population worldwide. CDC describes chronic disease as the leading cause of death and disability in the U.S. As of 2012, about half of all adults&mdash;117 million people&mdash;had one or more chronic health conditions. One of four adults had two or more chronic health conditions. Many chronic diseases can be prevented and effectively controlled through lifestyle modifications and public awareness. It is important that communities learn how to prevent chronic illness and how to help people living with chronic illness. The goal of this organization is to educate the community and raise awareness about chronic conditions and diseases. This group is student-led and aims to have discussions on chronic illness and organize events around raising awareness. This group will also provide a community for students to hear or share experiences living with chronic conditions and gain information from others about managing living with different chronic conditions in a safe and welcoming environment. This organization is open to everyone, not just people with chronic conditions/diseases. If you are considering a career in the healthcare field, wanting to help or meet other people in the PSU community with chronic conditions, share or hear about living with a chronic condition(s), or just looking to learn more about chronic conditions, this is a great opportunity! We are currently recruiting new members and leaders to join! We are having monthly discussion-based meetings and events. Please contact the listed email if you would like to join or get more information. Thank you for your interest in CCAA!</p>",
