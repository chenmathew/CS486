      "description": "<p>Phi Delta Epsilon International Co-ed Medical Fraternity creates physicians of integrity with a life-long commitment to our guiding principles of philanthropy, deity, and education through fellowship, service, mentoring, and formal training in leadership, science, and ethics. Phi Delta Epsilon was founded over 100 years ago as a professional fraternity supporting the need for camaraderie and mentoring among medical students. Since then, the membership has changed dramatically but the mission and objectives of our organization remain the same.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>PhiDE provides educational opportunities, supports philanthropic projects, and serves as a foundation for the development of relationships among medical professionals throughout the entire spectrum of a medical career. Through a host of planned activities during the academic year, students develop leadership and professional skills, which complement a basic understanding of medical science. When the time comes to apply for medical school or match for residency, active membership in PhiDE is evidence that a student is well-rounded and motivated.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In addition to our numerous resources for the MCAT and boards, there are also many chapter activities to help relieve the stress of studying. We recognize that the path to becoming a physician can be quite daunting, so it is important to us that we maintain a well-rounded lifestyle of education, fun, philanthropy, and self-care. Being in a group of like-minded individuals makes it easier to grapple with the challenging topics/obstacles that the medical and pre-medical pathways can procure.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The requirements to join Phi Delta Epsilon include:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>- Being an undergraduate/post-bac PSU student that is on a declared pre-medical track (this is irrespective of a student's declared major(s) and or minor(s))</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>- Having and maintaining a GPA of at least 3.2</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>- Being able to attend at least 75% of our chapter meetings/events for each term (chapter meeting times vary by term)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>- Being able to complete at least 10 hours of volunteer work per calendar year</p>",
