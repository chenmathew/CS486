      "description": "<p>Our mission is to empower learners and leaders in the Portland region and beyond to develop inter-professional connections and competencies to improve the services and systems that promote health. Our vision is a growing network of innovative leaders working on the frontier to improve the health of our communities. The Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) Open School aims to fill an educational void for health profession students by providing free, online curricula focused on patient safety and quality improvement. Additionally, the IHI Open School provides opportunities for hands-on learning through Chapters like ours. Our Chapter is making a difference by growing a local, interprofessional community of learners and leaders in health-related fields. We are part of an international movement that recognizes that we are all patients at some point in our lives, so patients should come first! As students in Oregon, we are committed to increasing access to health care, decreasing error, and improving the quality of health and health services in our community through a collaborative, interprofessional network. While our Chapter is currently affiliated with two universities, we welcome participation from all students, faculty, community members, consumers, and other professionals who are passionate about health care improvement. IHI empowers everyone to recognize flaws within the system and provides the tools to make change happen. Our Chapter can give you the resources, skills, and connections to create, maintain, and spread health care quality improvement efforts. Join us so we can make this a reality together!</p>",
