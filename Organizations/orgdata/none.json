      "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MCE is a student-first coalition of SPHR students aimed at building a space for students of color to come together and confront the realities of living in a predominantly white city, going to school on a predominantly white campus, and pursuing a career in a predominantly white field. As a group, we hope to support each other as we go through this both separate and shared experience. As we learn from each other, we hope to use our own experiences as students of color as a bridge towards success for all of us. MCE believes building a space for students of color in SPHR is necessary to hear ourselves and each other better. MCE believes in building a safe space for collaborative discussions and education around advocacy, allyship, and providing tools to create a safer and more supportive environment for the BIPOC community in school and work environments in SPHR. MCE is a space to connect to peer mentors in SPHR and develop personal and professional connections. MCE hopes to facilitate strong relationships and form a network of support in the field. This goal is crucial as members will continue to face the realities of being a person of color in the speech and hearing sciences field.</span></p>",
