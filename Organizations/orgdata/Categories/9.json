Phi Delta Epsilon was founded over 100 years ago as a professional fraternity supporting the need for camaraderie and mentoring among medical students. Since then, the membership has changed dramatically but the mission and objectives of our organization remain the same.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>PhiDE provides educational opportunities, supports philanthropic projects, and serves as a foundation for the development of relationships among medical professionals throughout the entire spectrum of a medical career. Through a host of planned activities during the academic year, students develop leadership and professional skills, which complement a basic understanding of medical science. When the time comes to apply for medical school or match for residency, active membership in PhiDE is evidence that a student is well-rounded and motivated.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In addition to our numerous resources for the MCAT and boards, there are also many chapter activities to help relieve the stress of studying. We recognize that the path to becoming a physician can be quite daunting, so it is important to us that we maintain a well-rounded lifestyle of education, fun, philanthropy, and self-care. Being in a group of like-minded individuals makes it easier to grapple with the challenging topics/obstacles that the medical and pre-medical pathways can procure.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The requirements to join Phi Delta Epsilon include:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>- Being an undergraduate/post-bac PSU student that is on a declared pre-medical track (this is irrespective of a student's declared major(s) and or minor(s))</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>- Having and maintaining a GPA of at least 3.2</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>- Being able to attend at least 75% of our chapter meetings/events for each term (chapter meeting times vary by term)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>- Being able to complete at least 10 hours of volunteer work per calendar year</p>",
