We are a student-organized and student-run group committed to enhancing the academic experience of linguistics students at PSU, while bringing linguistics to the broader PSU community. We hold a wide variety of events, from game nights to guest speaker nights. We aim to explore and promote many topics in linguistics and various other types of research, including education, language documentation and preservation, history, world languages and literatures, and computational linguistics. Our goal is to continuously broaden the horizons of applied linguistics students, by presenting various opportunities to see how linguistics education can be applied to these fields. Similarly, we hope to encourage dialogue and discussion among related fields, and those students and professionals working in such fields, to generate interest in the fruitful possibilities of studying languages and linguistics. If you are interested in SOAL or applied linguistics, please contact us at SOAL@pdx.edu.</p>",
